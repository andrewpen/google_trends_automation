Using Github as a notebook? Why not.

Let's try to keep a set of notes and thoughts. I want to get back to brain dumping but in a way that is structured and organized. 

One big grievance I have with Evernote is that I never go back and look at notes.

#Ideabook
- Ideas for scripts/apps/projects

#Blueprints
- Trying to formalize what the hell I want to do and turn it into an action plan

#Ramblings
- I gots to write. I know that I can do a good job once I get going. I also know it takes a lot of willpower to get me going.


Ok Braindump!
- Jupyter Notebooks? Is this something I need to get into? It looks like they are primarily used for Data Science and Python coding which seems cool but can it also be used for standard writing and thought organization?
- Go through my Meera books and just note out the Table of Contents. Will give me a good overview of each of the books and also tip me off where to dive in if I don't want to read the entire thing.
- LinkedIn Learning for blogging, writing, thought organization
- Learn Jenkins: an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for continuous integration purposes. It is used to build and test software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.
