Using Github as a notebook? Why not.

Let's try to keep a set of notes and thoughts. I want to get back to brain dumping but in a way that is structured and organized. 

One big grievance I have with Evernote is that I never go back and look at notes.

#Ideabook
- Ideas for scripts/apps/projects

#Blueprints
- Trying to formalize what the hell I want to do and turn it into an action plan

#Ramblings
- I gots to write. I know that I can do a good job once I get going. I also know it takes a lot of willpower to get me going.
